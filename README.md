Morphing Particle Sphere for Project 3
For the final project I plan to add music and responsiveness from the sphere based on the rhythms in the music.
Currently researching how to pull music from soundcloud as well as allowing user to input theire own .mp3 files.
For the final I also plan on adding key functionality in order to change the color scheme for the user.
